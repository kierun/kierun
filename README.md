I am an expert in cybersecurity & information security, software engineering,
and scientific research.

As the head of Information Security and cybersecurity, I developed security
policies, processes, and tooling from the ground up. I worked with frameworks
such as NIST Cybersecurity, SOC-2, and ISO 27,001 and defined governance and
policies for generative artificial intelligence.

As a scientific researcher, I worked in applied mathematical research and have a
proven track record in in game, graph, and optimisation theories, Bayesian
statistics. I hold a doctorate in theoretical astrophysics.

In engineering, I have a quarter of a century of experience developing
successful secure high performance software applications and large scale
architectures as well as deep knowledge of DevOps, some dating back to before
the DevOps term was coined. This includes the development and administration of
the largest email system in Europe, nanometre metrology of silicon wafers, and
command & control of giant underwater robots.

During my career, I have gained extensive experience in all the technical
aspects of software engineering and security, from performance critical
algorithm implementation through to high-level application architectures.

I have managed teams across multiple disciplines (Developers, DevOps, and SQA)
and taken projects from conception to delivery using pragmatic, evolutionary
methodologies.

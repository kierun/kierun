As an accomplished leader in greenfield project management, I adeptly
incorporate security protocols from the project's inception, thereby emphasising
a proactive Shift Left approach. During my quarter of a century career, I have
gained extensive experience in all aspects of Cybersecurity and information
security governance, multi-discipline team & project management, and software
engineering. I implemented and optimised performance critical algorithm and
applied them to high-level application architectures. Successfully managing
teams across various disciplines, I navigate projects from conception to
delivery using pragmatic, evolutionary methodologies. I apply modern security
best practices, including generative artificial intelligence, consistently
throughout my work.

In the Agile/Lean style, I value:

- **Transparency** and **maintainability** over information silos and
  obfuscation.
- Quality systems build on **understanding** and **collaboration** over heroic
  individuals and generic tools.
- **Continuous refinement** over big changes.
- Leaving code in a **better state** over letting bad code live.

Notes

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Cybersecurity & InfoSec governance, and Generative
  Artificial Intelligence.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many secret things,
  [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) being one of them!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about all things mathematical, astrophysical, engineering, or
  Cybersecurity/InfoSec related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: need to knowâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play many [FromSoftware](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) games
  despite being a casual scrubâ€¦

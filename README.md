During my quarter of a century career, I have gained extensive experience in all
aspects of Cybersecurity and information security governance, multi-discipline
team & project management, and software engineering. I implemented and optimised
performance critical algorithms and applied them to high-level application
architectures. I have managed teams across multiple disciplines and taken
projects from conception to delivery using pragmatic, evolutionary
methodologies. I applied modern security best practices to Cybersecurity and
InfoSec governance, including generative artificial intelligence.

I value:

- Leaving code in a better state over letting bad code live.
- Clarity and maintainability over information silos, and obfuscation.
- Quality systems build on understanding and collaboration over heroic
  individuals and generic tools.
- Continuous refinement over big changes.

Notes

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Cybersecurity & InfoSec governance and Gen AI.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many secret things,
  [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) being one of them!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about all things mathematical, astrophysical, engineering, or
  Cybersecurity/InfoSec related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: need to knowâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play many [FromSoftware](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) games
  despite being a casual scrubâ€¦
